#
# Run this command to always ignore formatting commits in `git blame`
# git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# This is picked up automatically on GitHub since the file is called
# .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# New git revision numbers can be appended to this file if needed.

# Apply `black` (v23.3.0) to entire code base
