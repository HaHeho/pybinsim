PyBinSim
========

Install
-------

Let's create a virtual environment. Use either Python or Conda to do this and then use `pip` to install the dependencies.

Windows
-------

Assuming you are using the default command line 
(navigate to `pyBinSim/` folder in Explorer, click into the address bar, type `cmd` and hit enter).


python

::
    $ <PathToPython >= 3.6> -m venv venv
    $ venv/Scripts/activate.bat
    $ pip install pybinsim

For Powershell, the activation command is `venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1`.


conda

::
    $ conda create --name binsim python=3.6 numpy
    $ conda activate binsim
    $ pip install pybinsim


Linux
-----

On linux, make sure that gcc and the development headers for libfftw and portaudio are installed, before invoking `pip install pybinsim`.

For ubuntu

::

    $ apt-get install gcc portaudio19-dev libfftw3-dev

For Fedora

::

    $ sudo dnf install gcc portaudio19-devel fftw-devel


python

::
    $ <PathToPython >= 3.6> -m venv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install pybinsim


conda

::
    $ conda create --name binsim python=3.6 numpy
    $ conda activate binsim
    $ pip install pybinsim
    

Run
---

Create ``pyBinSimSettings.txt`` file with content like this

::

soundfile signals/speech2_48000_mono.wav
blockSize 128
ds_filterSize 256
early_filterSize 3072
late_filterSize 32768
filterList brirs/filtermap.txt
maxChannels 2
samplingRate 48000
enableCrossfading True
useHeadphoneFilter True
headphone_filterSize 1024
loudnessFactor 0.5
loopSound True
pauseConvolution False
pauseAudioPlayback False


Start Binaural Simulation

::

    import pybinsim
    import logging

    pybinsim.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)    # defaults to INFO
    #Use logging.WARNING for printing warnings only

    with pybinsim.BinSim('pyBinSimSettings.txt') as binsim:
        binsim.stream_start()

Description
===========

Basic principle:
----------------

Depending on the number of input channels (wave-file channels) the corresponding number of virtual sound sources is created. The filter for each sound source can selected and activitated via OSC messages. The messages basically contain the number
index of the source for which the filter should be switched and an identifier string to address the correct filter. The correspondence between parameter value and filter is determined by a filter list which can be adjusted individually for the specific use case.
    
Config parameter description:
-----------------------------

soundfile: 
    Defines \*.wav file which is played back at startup. Sound file can contain up to maxChannels audio channels. Also accepts multiple files separated by '#'; Example: 'soundfile signals/sound1.wav#signals/sound2.wav
blockSize: 
    Number of samples which are processed per block. Low values reduce delay but increase cpu load.
ds_filterSize: 
    Defines filter size of the direct sound filters loaded with the filter list. Filter size should be a mutltiple of blockSize.
early_filterSize: 
    Defines filter size of the early filters loaded with the filter list. Filter size should be a mutltiple of blockSize.
late_filterSize: 
    Defines filter size of the late reverb filters loaded with the filter list. Filter size should be a mutltiple of blockSize.
headphone_filterSize: 
    Defines filter size of the headphone compensation filters loaded with the filter list. Filter size should be a mutltiple of blockSize.    
maxChannels: 
    Maximum number of sound sources/audio channels which can be controlled during runtime. The value for maxChannels must match or exceed the number of channels of soundFile(s).
samplingRate: 
    Sample rate for filters and soundfiles. Caution: No automatic sample rate conversion.
enableCrossfading: 
    Enable cross fade between audio blocks. Set 'False' or 'True'.
useHeadphoneFilter: 
    Enables headhpone equalization. The filterset should contain a filter with the identifier HPFILTER. Set 'False' or 'True'.
loudnessFactor: 
    Factor for overall output loudness. Attention: Clipping may occur
loopSound:
    Enables looping of sound file or sound file list. Set 'False' or 'True'.
pauseConvolution:
    Bypasses convolution
pauseAudioPlayback:
    Audio playback is paused

OSC Messages and filter lists:
------------------------------

Example lines from filter list:

::

    HPFILTER hpirs/DT990_EQ_filter_2ch.wav
    DSFILTER 165 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 brirs/kemar_0_165_ds.wav
    EARLYFILTER 165 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 brirs/kemar_0_165_early.wav
    LATEFILTER 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 brirs/late_reverb.wav

Lines with the prefix DSFILTER,EARLYFILTER and LATEFILTER contain a 'filter key' which consist of 6 or 9 positive numbers. These numbers
can be arbitrarily assigned to suit your use case. They are used to tell pyBinSim which filter to apply.
The filter behind the prefix HPFILTER will be loaded and applied automatically when useHeadphoneFilter == True.
Lines which start with DSFILTER,EARLYFILTER or LATEFILTE have to be called via OSC commands to become active.
To activate a DSFILTER for the third channel of your wav file you have to send the the identifier
'/pyBinSim_ds_Filter', followed by a 2 (corresponding to the third channel) and followed by the nine 9 key numbers from the filter list
to the pc where pyBinSim runs (UDP, port 10000):

::

    /pyBinSim_ds_Filter 2 165 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

When you want to apply an early filter

::

    /pyBinSim_early_Filter 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0


When you want to apply a late filter

::

    /pyBinSim_late_Filter 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
      
        
When you want to play another sound file you send:

::

    /pyBinSimFile folder/file_new.wav

Or a sound file list:

::

    /pyBinSimFile folder/file_1.wav#folder/file_2.wav

The audiofile has to be located on the pc where pyBinSim runs. Files are not transmitted over network.

Further OSC Messages:
------------------------------

Pause audio playback. Send 'True' or 'False' (as string, not bool)

::

    /pyBinSimPauseAudioPlayback 'True'

Bypass convolution. Send 'True' or 'False' (as string, not bool)

::

    /pyBinSimPauseConvolution 'True'
